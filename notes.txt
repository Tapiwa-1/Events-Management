System Overview: Multi-Vertical Event Resource Planner
This system functions as a Centralized Resource & Logistics Engine. Unlike a standard retail system, an events business combines three distinct operational models into one timeline: Asset Rental (Deco, PA Systems), Service Booking (Photography), and Custom Manufacturing (Cakes).

The system's primary goal is to prevent "operational collisions"—ensuring that the PA system rented to Client A isn't also promised to Client B, while simultaneously managing the production schedule for a cake and the calendar of a photographer for the same or different events.

Core Functional Modules
To manage these different business lines without conflict, the system is divided into four logical modules that feed into a central "Master Schedule."

1. The Asset Rental Module (Deco & PA Systems)
This module manages "returnable inventory." It treats items like speakers, amplifiers, table runners, and centerpieces as assets that have a check-out and check-in status.

Inventory Logic: It tracks total stock vs. available stock for specific dates. It accounts for "buffer time" (maintenance/cleaning) between rentals.

Bundling: It allows grouping items (e.g., "Gold Wedding Package" includes 10 centerpieces + 2 PA speakers).

Wear & Tear Tracking: It flags items for repair upon return (e.g., a blown speaker or stained tablecloth) so they are removed from availability.

2. The Service Availability Module (Photography)
This module manages "time slots" rather than physical stock. It functions like a calendar appointment system.

Personnel Allocation: It links bookings to specific photographers. If you have two photographers, the system allows two simultaneous photo bookings but blocks a third.

Deliverable Tracking: It tracks post-event workflows, such as editing time, photo selection, and final album delivery.

3. The Production Module (Cakes)
This module manages "consumable custom orders." Unlike the rentals, these items do not come back.

Lead Time Management: It enforces ordering deadlines based on complexity (e.g., "Wedding cakes require 14 days notice").

Requirement Capture: It provides structured forms for dietary restrictions, flavor profiles, and design reference uploads.

Production Stages: It tracks the status of the order: Order Received -> Baking -> Decorating -> Ready for Dispatch.

4. The Logistics & Dispatch Module (The Glue)
This is the operational heart that connects the other three. It organizes the physical movement of goods and people.

Route Planning: It groups deliveries for the same day (e.g., dropping off the PA system and the Cake at the same venue).

Recovery Scheduling: It generates "Pick-up Lists" for the day after the event to retrieve the Deco and PA equipment.

The User Journey (Workflow)
Here is how data flows through the system from a business logic perspective:

Phase 1: Inquiry & Availability Check

The client inputs an event date.

The system performs a Conflict Check:

Are enough chairs available? (Inventory Check)

Is the photographer free? (Calendar Check)

Is there oven capacity for the cake? (Production Capacity Check)

Phase 2: Reservation & Deposit

A "Tentative Hold" is placed on the assets and time slots.

Upon deposit payment, the status converts to "Confirmed," permanently reducing the available stock/time for that date so other clients cannot book them.

Phase 3: Fulfillment (The Event)

Dispatch Note: Generated for the warehouse team to load the PA and Deco.

Job Sheet: Generated for the photographer with venue details and shot lists.

Delivery Order: Generated for the cake with handling instructions.

Phase 4: Return & Reconciliation

Check-in: The Deco and PA systems are scanned back into the warehouse.

Damage Report: If a microphone is missing or a vase is broken, the system flags the client's security deposit for deduction.

Service Closeout: The photographer uploads the final images, marking the job as complete.

Key System Requirements
Real-Time Dashboard: A calendar view showing which equipment is out, which cakes are due, and where photographers are located on any given day.

Dynamic Pricing: The ability to charge differently based on rental duration (e.g., 24-hour hire vs. weekend hire) or seasonality.

Contract Generation: Automatically merging the rental terms (for damage liability) with the service agreement (for photography rights) and the purchase agreement (for the cake) into a single client document.

System features
1. Unified Calendar & Scheduling
Master Conflict Detector: A central calendar that flags overlaps immediately. If you try to book the "Gold PA System" for a wedding on Saturday, but it’s already reserved for a corporate event, the system blocks the action.

Multi-View Timeline:

Production View: Shows the bakery team what cakes need to be baked vs. decorated today.

Logistics View: Shows the driver which equipment needs to be dropped off and picked up.

Staff View: Shows the photographer where they need to be and at what time.

2. Smart Inventory Management (Deco & PA)
Bundling & Packages: The ability to create a single "item" called "Wedding Gold Package" that, when booked, automatically reserves 50 chairs, 10 tables, 2 speakers, and 1 mixer from your inventory count.

Buffer Time Configuration: Automatically adds a "maintenance window" after a rental. If a PA system returns Sunday night, the system blocks it from being rented Monday morning to allow time for testing and cable coiling.

Damage & Repair Logging: A feature to flag specific items (e.g., "Speaker #3") as "Damaged/In Repair." This removes the item from available inventory so sales staff don't accidentally rent out broken equipment.

Barcode/QR Check-in: A scanning feature for warehouse staff to quickly check items out before an event and scan them back in upon return to verify everything came back.

3. Service Management (Photography)
Photographer Assignment: Assign specific shooters to specific jobs. If you have freelancers, you can track who is working which event.

Post-Production Tracker: Tracks the stages of the service after the event: "Raw Photos Backed Up" -> "Editing in Progress" -> "Client Review" -> "Final Album Delivered."

Digital Asset Link: A field in the client's booking where the final Google Drive or Dropbox link for their photos can be stored and automatically emailed to them.

4. Custom Order Management (Cakes)
Visual Reference Uploads: A feature allowing clients or staff to upload inspiration pictures, color palettes, or sketches directly to the order ticket for the bakers to follow.

Dietary Requirement Flags: High-visibility tags for "Nut Free," "Gluten Free," or "Vegan" that appear on the job sheet to prevent cross-contamination in the kitchen.

Staged Production Status: Updates specific to making the item, such as "Ingredients Prepped," "In Oven," "Cooling," "Decorating," and "Boxed for Delivery."

5. Financials & Client Relations (CRM)
Multi-Quote Generation: The ability to create a quote that separates "Rentals" (which require a security deposit) from "Consumables" (Cakes, which do not).

Automated Contract Generation: Generates a single PDF contract that covers:

Rental Agreement (Liability for broken deco/PA).

Model Release (Rights to use the photos).

Design Approval (Client sign-off on the cake design).

Payment Milestones: specific tracking for "Booking Fee/Deposit" vs. "Final Balance," with automated email reminders sent 7 days before the event.

6. Logistics & Delivery
Route Optimization: A daily feature that groups deliveries by location. If the Cake and the Deco are going to the same venue, it creates a single "Load Sheet" for the van.

Pick-Up Lists: A generated checklist for the driver for the day after the event, detailing exactly which chairs, cables, and stands need to be retrieved from the venue.
